# Hackathon Project

## Boredom Solver

This project is designed to resolve the main issue that many of us are experiencing right now - boredom. It's been months since you've seen your friends and family, months since you've seen the inside of a cafe, you can only dress your pet up in so many outfits before they start to get mad at you. We have just the solution for you - our site. There's trivia, random activities, insults, cat pics and more!
